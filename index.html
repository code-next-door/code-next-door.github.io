    <div class="container">
        <p>The Great Hall was abuzz with excitement as the first-year students stood nervously in a line, awaiting their turn to be sorted into one of the four houses. The enchanted ceiling mirrored the starlit sky outside, casting a serene yet awe-inspiring ambiance over the room. Professors and older students watched eagerly as Professor McGonagall stepped forward, holding a long roll of parchment.</p>
        <img src="placeholder.jpg" alt="Image of the Great Hall">
        <p>"Vasuuu!" she called out.</p>
        <img src="placeholder.jpg" alt="Image of Vasuuu">
        <p>A girl with curious eyes and a slight frown stepped forward. Vasuuu approached the three-legged stool where the old, battered Sorting Hat rested. She took a deep breath, sat down, and the hat was placed on her head. It slid down, covering her eyes.</p>
        <img src="placeholder.jpg" alt="Image of the Sorting Hat">
        <p>"Hmm," the Sorting Hat's voice murmured in her ear. "Interesting... very interesting. You're quite the enigma, aren't you?"</p>
        <img src="placeholder.jpg" alt="Image of Online Quiz">
        <p>Vasuuu's mind raced. She remembered the quiz she had taken on the internet a few months back. It had said she belonged in Hufflepuff, but she wasn't sure. Was she brave like a Gryffindor? Wise like a Ravenclaw? Ambitious like a Slytherin?</p>
        <p>The Sorting Hat chuckled. "Ah, I see you've consulted the Muggle invention called the internet. And an online quiz, no less! Those can be quite fun, but not always accurate. You see, I can see your thoughts, your potential, your deepest desires. You are brave, yes, but there's more to you than that."</p>
        <p>Vasuuu's heart pounded. "Please, just choose the right house," she thought desperately.</p>
        <p>The hat seemed to consider her plea. "Bravery, wisdom, ambition... but above all, you value loyalty and hard work. You're dedicated and patient, even if fair play isn't always your priority. And yes, there's that old internet quiz nudging me in a certain direction. Very well, then."</p>
        <p>The hat paused dramatically before announcing, "HUFFLEPUFF!"</p>
        <img src="placeholder.jpg" alt="Image of Hufflepuff House">
        <p>The Hufflepuff table erupted in cheers. Vasuuu sighed in relief as she took off the hat, feeling a sense of belonging wash over her. She walked over to the Hufflepuff table, greeted by warm smiles and welcoming handshakes. She took her seat, glancing back at the stool where the Sorting Hat now rested quietly.</p>
        <img src="placeholder.jpg" alt="Image of Vasuuu Sitting at the Hufflepuff Table">
        <p>As the Sorting continued, Vasuuu's mind wandered. She realized that, despite her confusion, the Sorting Hat had seen her true self. She knew she was in the right place.</p>
        <img src="placeholder.jpg" alt="Image of Hogwarts Castle">
        <p>Professor McGonagall called out the next name, and the ceremony went on. But for Vasuuu, the moment was magical and reassuring. She was a Hufflepuff, and she was ready to begin her journey at Hogwarts.</p>
